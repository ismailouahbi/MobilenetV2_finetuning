* ### Introduction
`MobileNetV2` is a popular deep learning model that was introduced `by Google in 2018` as an improvement over its predecessor, `MobileNetV1`. It is `designed specifically for mobile and embedded devices with limited computational resources`. 

The primary goal of MobileNetV2 is to provide a `lightweight and efficient architecture` while still achieving competitive accuracy in various computer vision tasks.
